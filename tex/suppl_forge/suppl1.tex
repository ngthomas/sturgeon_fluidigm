{\em Scatter figures like Figure~1 for all SNP assays } }




\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section*{Overview/Orientation}
This supplement contains all the scatter plots like those that appear in Figure~1
of the paper to which this is a supplement.  

Figures 1, 3, 5, and 7 in this supplement correspond to the plots in Figure~1{\em a} in the paper.

Figures 2, 4, 6, 8 in this supplement correspond to the plots in Figure~1{\em b} in the paper.

The caption from Figure 1 in the original paper applies to these figures and is paraphrased here as a single
caption for all of the supplemental figures:
\begin{quotation}
Raw \snptype{} fluorescence intensities at all 96 assays typed upon the four
scoring-development chips. Each panel
shows the results at four chips for one locus.  The numeral in the upper right gives the number
of genotype categories that are scored at the locus.  Each point represents an individual's fluorescence
intensities at two dyes. {\bf Figures~1,~3,~5,~7}: Individuals are colored according to chip and dashed line
segments connect the intensities of individuals typed on different chips. {\bf Figures~2,~4,~6,~8}: Individuals are colored
according to the genotype category to which they have been scored.  Category~0 (colored light gray) is a ``no call'', \ie the individual
is recorded as having missing data at the locus. \end{quotation}
