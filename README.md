## Steps To Reproduce the Analysis

All the data and scripts to reproduce our analyses are included herein.

1. _Preliminaries_: First, you have to get the repository.  Do it like this:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ngthomas/sturgeon_fluidigm
```
Then you should ensure that you have all the R libraries that we use:  (LIST)

2. Run a series of R scripts.  We have all the necessary scripts set up to run in 
order in the directory `./R-main/`.  Each of them should be run with the current
working directory in R set to be the top level of the repository. (i.e. the directory
that includes the subdirectory `R-main`). Here we briefly describe what each script does:
    a. _01-develop-chip-scoring.R_  describe, describe
    b. _02-process-scored-training-data-chips.R_ describe describe
